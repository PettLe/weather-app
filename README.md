This project is all about APIs and Promises/Async/Await.
It needs to be stated that at this point setting up a project has become really complex. It's not just creating repository anymore
and then cloning it and creating html, css and js. Webpack, Babel, CSS-loaders, configs and stuff. It's hard to remember anymore what to do
and to this point, I've been referring to old lessons. So: I finally created simple step-by-step notes. FINALLY.

This has been a fun project. Especially after the last one which took me two weeks.. I'm not saying I now fully understand all the intricacies of async,
await, fetch and API, but I managed to impliment them and I have basic understanding. Not bad for the first time using them.
Project itself took three days. But to be honest I didn't spend but only few hours per day.

The basic code is fairly short and compact so I opted to do it all in a single JS file, instead of dividing it into modules.

I could have created many more small features into this, but I feel like it would be kind of unnecessary in terms of things and techniques this project
was supposed to teach. So I guess it's best for now to just move on and maybe come back later for fun. I really enjoyed this one!

The one thing I do hate in my design: I have feature that displays either 12-hour or 5 days weather. I basically copy/pasted my ready functionlity twice
and just added a new eventListener. I'm sure there is 100 times better way to achieve the same in shorter code, but I just didn't think of it early
enough (or more like a decided in the beginning not to do it and changed my mind) and implementing the 5 day option in a reasonable way was probably
way too late without refactoring everything. So it is what it is.
