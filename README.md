This project is all about APIs and Promises/Async/Await.
It needs to be stated that at this point setting up a project has become really complex. It's not just creating repository anymore
and then cloning it and creating html, css and js. Webpack, Babel, CSS-loaders, configs and stuff. It's hard to remember anymore what to do
and to this point, I've been referring to old lessons. So: I finally created simple step-by-step notes. FINALLY.
